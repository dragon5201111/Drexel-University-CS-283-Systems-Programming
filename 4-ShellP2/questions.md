1. Can you think of why we use `fork/execvp` instead of just calling `execvp` directly? What value do you think the `fork` provides?

    > **Answer**:  We use fork/execvp instead of directly calling execvp because,  if we didn't the entire memory footprint of our shell would be replaced with whatever is to be ran by execvp. The fork provides a copy of a parent process, in our case, the shell, which is valuable because now we have a process that can be overwritten by another process our shell wants to run.

2. What happens if the fork() system call fails? How does your implementation handle this scenario?

    > **Answer**:  If the fork system call fails, errno is set and no child process is created. My implementation checks if fork fails and returns errno to the main execution context to be handled elsewhere.

3. How does execvp() find the command to execute? What system environment variable plays a role in this process?

    > **Answer**:  execvp uses the PATH environment variable to find out where a command is located.

4. What is the purpose of calling wait() in the parent process after forking? What would happen if we didnâ€™t call it?

    > **Answer**:  The purpose of callling wait is to suspend the parent process's execution until the child process it created has finished running, allowing the parent to retrieve the exit status of the child process before continuing its own execution. If we didn't wait, the parent process could potentially finish execution before the child process creating a zombie process, wasting system resources.

5. In the referenced demo code we used WEXITSTATUS(). What information does this provide, and why is it important?

    > **Answer**:  This WEXITSTATUS() performs a bitwise and operation (mask) followed by a right shift of 8 bits. This extracts the exit status of a child process. This is important because our shell needs to be able to report the exit status of an executed command to help debug failing commands.

6. Describe how your implementation of build_cmd_buff() handles quoted arguments. Why is this necessary?

    > **Answer**:  It is necessary to handle quoted arguments because tokens are delimitted by whitespace (typically in a shell). In other words, there would be no way for tokens with spaces to exist if quotes did not exist to demarcate what includes spaces. My implementation of build_cmd_buff calls a helper function to format the raw command line string. This helper function strips leading and trailing whitespace and then uses a finite state machine (boolean variable) to check for quotes.

7. What changes did you make to your parsing logic compared to the previous assignment? Were there any unexpected challenges in refactoring your old code?

    > **Answer**:  I for one, could not use strtok anymore to split over whitespace. I had to do things "manually", first by removing leading and trailing whitespace, then, reducing multiple whitespace to singular whitespace. Finally, I had to maintain whitespace inside quotes.

8. For this quesiton, you need to do some research on Linux signals. You can use [this google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=Linux+signals+overview+site%3Aman7.org+OR+site%3Alinux.die.net+OR+site%3Atldp.org&oq=Linux+signals+overview+site%3Aman7.org+OR+site%3Alinux.die.net+OR+site%3Atldp.org&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzc2MGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to get started.

- What is the purpose of signals in a Linux system, and how do they differ from other forms of interprocess communication (IPC)?

    > **Answer**:  The purpose of a linux signal is to  provide a mechanism for processes to communicate with each other and respond to various events. Each signal serves a specific purpose, from controlling processes to notifying them about events or requesting specific actions. Linux signals differ in the sense that they are primarily used to deliver notifications about process events like errors and to handle those events whereas other forms of IPC might transfer pipe data or exchange data. 

- Find and describe three commonly used signals (e.g., SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGINT). What are their typical use cases?

    > **Answer**:  SIGKILL - sent to a process to cause it to terminate. For example, hardware exceptions such as if a process was to divide by 0. SIGINT - a signal generated when a user presses Control-C, that will terminate the program from the terminal. SIGTERM - sends a request to terminate a program. For example, when we want to gracefully end a program with some cleanup.

- What happens when a process receives SIGSTOP? Can it be caught or ignored like SIGINT? Why or why not?

    > **Answer**:  When a process receives SIGSTOP, it stops the process. It differs from SIGINT because it isn't interactive; it's not a request, but an order for a process to terminate.
